# Derivative song list
Tired that the top 50 of your country is the same across many weeks? What if instead of total views you could sort by the increase of the views in a week? Or the velocity? Or the acceleration? Or the change in acceleration? Or anything in between?

In between? What am I talking about?

## Fractional derivatives

The velocity can be defined as just the first derivative of a function f'(x) from now f1(x), the acceleration would be f2(x), the change in acceleration would be the f3(x). What if we took the function f1.5(x), is that even possible? What would that even mean?

If you plot for example all of the derivatives from the function x^2 from f0(x) to f1(x) you see the transition from the parabola we all know and love transforming into a classic linear function [Figure 1](Figure_1.png).
